- **AI-powered process analysis** for optimization recommendations

## Demo Features

### Interactive Global Site Map
- Real-time visualization of 4 Toyota manufacturing plants
- Color-coded efficiency indicators (Green: High, Yellow: Medium, Red: Low)
- Interactive plant selection with detailed drill-down

### Asset Discovery & Inventory
- Comprehensive asset tracking (PLC Controllers, HMI Systems, Robots, Sensors, etc.)
- Real-time asset health monitoring with trend analysis
- Performance metrics and efficiency calculations

### Process Flow Visualization
- Interactive process flow diagrams showing manufacturing steps
- Bottleneck identification and optimization recommendations
- AI-powered process analysis with automation suggestions

### Automation Intelligence
- Smart recommendations based on plant performance
